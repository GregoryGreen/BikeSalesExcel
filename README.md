# BikeSalesExcel

This project explores how various demographics affects bike sales. The project was also a great exercise on how to clean data using remove duplicates, nulls, find and replace, if statements, and reformat dates. Created pivot tables to group specific columns into different charts that tell stories on how people purchase bikes. In this case, the goal was to view bike sales compared to income, gender, age, and commuting distance. I inserted slicers for Marital Status, Region, and Education. These three different slicers were connected to each of the tables. Now, I am able to interact with the data set and can visually see the number of Bike Sales for someone who is married or single, living in North America, Europe, or Pacific, and has a degree.
